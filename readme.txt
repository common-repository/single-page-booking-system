A WordPress plugin that adds i-rent.net's rental booking system to a chosen page.

== Description ==

Introducing the i-rent.net Accommodation Rental Plugin for WordPress!

Exclusively designed for i-rent.net clients, this plugin seamlessly integrates with your WordPress website to showcase and manage accommodations. With a user-friendly booking system powered by the i-rent.net property management platform, you can provide a hassle-free experience for your guests.
This WordPress plugin integrates the simple rental booking system from i-rent.net into a selected page on the user’s website.

The plugin establishes a secure connection to the authentication API at “https://api.auth.i-rent.net/apps/authenticate”. This connection enables the user to gain access to the Property Management System (PMS). Upon successful authentication, the user is provided with a script from “https://scriptvjs.i-rent.net/js/app.js”. This script forms the bridge between the user’s WordPress page and the i-rent.net system.

The authentication process is a crucial security measure designed to protect both the usage of the plugin and the integrity of the data. It ensures that only authorized users can access the PMS and interact with the data therein. This way, the security and privacy of the system and the data it manages are maintained.

The script utilizes Vue.js technology and Material Design principles to construct the user interface that will be inserted into the user’s webpage. This combination allows for a dynamic, responsive, and visually appealing interface that enhances the user experience.

In essence, this process ensures a seamless integration of the script into the user’s webpage, while preserving the aesthetic and functional aspects of both the script and the webpage. It’s a meticulous design choice aimed at delivering an optimal and consistent user experience.

Use of a Third-Party Service
This plugin relies on a third-party service, i-rent.net, to provide its functionality. Specifically, it connects to two services from i-rent.net:
    1 - i-rent.net Authentication API: This API is used to authenticate the user into the Property Management System (PMS). The URL for the API is “https://api.auth.i-rent.net/apps/authenticate”.
    2 - i-rent.net Script: This script provides the user interface that gets inserted into the user’s webpage. The URL for the script is “https://scriptvjs.i-rent.net/js/app.js”.
For more information about these services, including their terms of use and privacy policies (https://www.i-rent.net/privacy-policy-and-terms-conditions/), please visit i-rent.net. For any additional questions, you can refer to the FAQ page (https://i-rent.net/faq/).
